### Yeoman Single Malt

More docs coming soon...

One note about this. I'm using NPM for all `js` dependencies and Bower for all `css` dependencies.

## Usage

Until this is completely working I won't be putting it on NPM.

To use now, follow these steps.

- Clone this repo
- Navigate to the location and run `npm link`
- This will link up the generator for usage
- Now, as long as you have Yeoman installed, you can run the generator with `yo single-malt`

## Uninstalation

Provided you have the current version of NPM, you can just run `npm unlink` and you will be fine.
